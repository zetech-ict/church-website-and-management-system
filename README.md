Note: There was a mix-up while cloning the repository from my local machine to github, while I've made commits via direct uploads to the Folder above in this repository, more detailed commits that were made straight from my VScode app are available at https://github.com/mike-mike-8000/NEW-church-management-project

Thank You.
## Background.
Many churches today are facing a similar grievance. Population and consequently membership has grown exponentially over time and the current manual systems of administrative management and communication are unable to keep up. 
It is becoming increasingly tiresome and inefficient for church leaders to manage their congregation, activities and events. 
This is where a Church Website and Management System comes in. The aim of this system is to digitize the churchesâ€™ administrative work for increased efficiency in running the church. It will be a significant improvement over current manual systems in place at some churches. It will be complemented by a website that will be used to communicate with church members and advertise the church to those who may be interested in joining.##

## 1.1.	Objectives.
### By the end of this project, the system should be able to:
* (i).	Register New Members.
* (ii).	Store information on Church Members.
* (iii).	Keep track of church finances. And contributions.
* (iv).	Make church announcements.
* (v).	Talk about the church to advertise to potential members.
* (vi).	Keep members informed on upcoming church activities.
* (vii).	Provide means of contacting the church
