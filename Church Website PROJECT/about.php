    <h1 style="text-align: center;">ABOUT OUR CHURCH</h1>
    <p>Our church started in October 2009 with a small group of people with a passion to 
        glorify God in Rosebank, downtown Nairobi. We didn’t have a lot of resources on our own, 
        but we believed we served a powerful God. After all, He raised Jesus from the dead and sat Him 
        at his right hand in the heavenly places! 
        Not only that, He raised us from the spiritual dead and gave us new life in Christ!
        <br><br>
        Over the past several years we have seen God do some amazing things in our midst. 
        The truth is, in many ways, from a human perspective 
        at least, this is a church that shouldn’t be possible.
        <br> 
        God cares for His people. We know that looking back to what He accomplished on the cross, 
        but we also know that from looking at what’s happening in the lives of individuals in our church, 
        and from what God is doing in our church as a community and family in Christ. 
        The book of Ephesians says the church is God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, 
        which He prepared beforehand for us to do. And looking at our church, we see the beauty of God’s work 
        on display week after week!<br>
        We would love to have you join us!<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
    <br>
    If you would like to pray for us: Please pray that we would clearly communicate God’s Word to people 
    from many different cultures, that God would use us to raise up missionaries for the people. And that God 
    would grow us in maturity as His church, and that God would enable us to clearly demonstrate the 
    wonders of His grace. Thank-you!
    </p>
